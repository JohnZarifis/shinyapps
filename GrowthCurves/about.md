Centile estimation includes methods for estimating the age-related distribution of
human growth. The standard estimation of centile curves usually involves two continuous variables:


1. the response variable, that is, the variable we are interested in and for which we
are trying to find the centile curves, e.g. weight, BMI, head circumference.


2. the explanatory variable, e.g. age.



We consider the conditional centile of Y given explanatory
variable X = x.

Centile curves can be obtained for different values of p. The
World Health Organization uses the values 100p=(3,15,50,85,97) in its charts and
100p=(1,3,5,15,25,50,75,85,95,97,99) in its tables. 

Centile estimation can be extended to more than one explanatory continuous variable,
e.g. age and height; see for example Cole et al. [2009] and Quanjer et al. [2012a] 
For explanatory categorical variables such as gender, the
usual practice is to produce separate charts for each level of the categorical variable.'
